🎵 Music Playlist Management System (C++)
This project is a console-based Music Playlist Management System developed in C++. It uses fundamental data structures (linked lists) to manage a playlist of songs with operations like adding, deleting, saving, and displaying songs. The application mimics basic functionality of a media playlist manager.


✅ Features / Modules Covered:
🎶 Add Song: Allows users to input song name, artist, and duration and appends it to the playlist.
❌ Delete Song: Removes a song from the playlist based on the song name.
💾 Save Playlist to File: Saves the current playlist to a .txt file in a formatted table.
📜 Display Playlist: Displays all songs in the current playlist with their details.
🚪 Exit Option: Allows the user to gracefully exit the application.


💡 Concepts & Topics Used:
C++ Structs and Classes
Singly Linked List (Dynamic Data Structure)
Pointers and Memory Management
File Handling using fstream
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles
Menu-Driven Interface using Switch Statements
User Input with cin and getline
